# Airline Company Data Analysis

This project focuses on assisting a major airline company in analyzing their current business processes and discovering new opportunities for expansion. The initial deliverable concentrates on analyzing flight activity to ensure efficient ongoing business processes. The objectives include understanding the travel patterns of frequent flyers, fare basis analysis, upgrade frequency, frequent flyer miles usage, response to fare promotions, duration of overnight stays, and the distribution of gold, platinum, and titanium status among frequent flyers. Additionally, the analysis encompasses the reservation process to evaluate company profits, considering multiple channels for reservations. Customer care interactions before, during, and after trips are also taken into account to address inquiries, complaints, and collect feedback for business improvement. The analysis includes categorizing the type of interaction and assessing problem severity if issues exist.

## Project Requirements

1. State the modeling process for each business process.
2. Construct a logical data model for the case study using a diagramming tool. Explain the rationale behind the chosen data model design and provide details about each component.
3. Translate the logical data model into a physical data model, including tables, columns (name, data type), primary indexes, and foreign indexes. Justify the use of specific index types for each column. Provide the output in an Excel file.
4. Create table(s) in the Oracle DBMS and populate them with sample data for query purposes.
5. Develop a set of SQL queries (5-8 queries) based on the physical data model design. Each query should address a specific business question related to the case study. Provide the queries and their corresponding business questions in a Word file.
6. Prepare a concise report (maximum 2 pages) discussing various types of indexes and partitions used in data warehousing and their significance in optimizing performance.

Please refer to the project documentation and files provided in this repository for detailed information and outputs related to each requirement.
